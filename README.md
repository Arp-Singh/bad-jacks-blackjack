## Overview

A simple game of blackjack made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. It's main purpose was to learn and focus on JavaScript concepts such as:

- Arrays
- Objects & Object Orientated Programming
- Booleans
- If else statements
- Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, etc)
- Logical Operators (&&, ||, etc)
- For loops
- The Math object
- Return statements
- DOM Manipulation

### Features

- Players should have a default, hard-coded amount of money when they click "Start Game". 
- The cards dealt are displayed on screen, as well as the sum of those cards. 
- Clicking on "New Card" should give a random new card drawn.
- Winning gives you "Blackjack!". Losing gives you "You've gone bust" and if you haven't hit either then you get a message asking "Do you want to draw another card?"
- You can customize your username!

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

- How to create objects and call their properties using the dot notation (object.property).
- Generation of random numbers, as well as flooring them to get an integer from a float value. 
- How to construct an array with multiple data types.
- Comparison & Logical operators and how their conditions can manipulate when certain behaviours occur (e.g. pressing new card should only happen if the person is in a round and has not gone bust or obtained blackjack).
- Return statements when passing arguments back.
- Initialising empty variables within JavaScript.


### Continued development
Future updates will include:
- Implementing Semantic HTML for better code practices.
- Change the design of the game to have a more dark, late night casino vibe. I want users to feel oddly cold but find some comfort in certain aspects like the cards or perhaps the occasional talk from the dealer.
- ~Create a prompt for usernames, store and display these on screen for a more personal feel to the game.~ (**FEATURE ADDED AS 17/12/2025**).
- Add an AI to play against:
    - Bob (Nicknamed Hammer)
    - Jill (Jack and Jill)
    - Dealer
- Add a betting system that allows you to bet a certain amount of your money, alongside with raising or lowering the bet. Can also change this value with keyboard input.
- Rendering out cards instead of numbers, as well as generating a deck to draw from, instead of cards popping out of thin air.
